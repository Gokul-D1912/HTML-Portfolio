<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>I'm Just Writing this like a Journel on how i feel today</h2>

<h3>Wednesday, Mar 19th, 2025</h3>

<p>upon on waking up and before going to bed, the same question rings in my head.."Am i doing What
  i always want to do. The Answer Remains <strong>"No"</strong>. And i know what i need
  to do, i need to change my habits that's eating me. I know what to do to change but i don't 
  do that. 
</p>

<p>why you may ask? </p>

<p>Its because i'm damn too comfortable in my comfort Zone wanting success without doing a thing.
  Its like <strong>"Day by Day i'm becoming what i Hate</strong>...
</p>

<p>I know the sheer Ugliness of the World, Everyone says that the world is all 
  Rainbows and Sunshine, <strong>BUT THEY HAVEN'T SEEN WHAT I SAW, AND WHAT I FELT</strong>

</p>

<P>I know the ugliness of this world and yet i don't do a goddamn thing to change it... 
  As if i cross the days struggling to fill the plates for my family and be selfish like the Masses....
</P>

<Strong>BUT YET I Must TRY.......</Strong>

<p> To see if want i'm doing will make a change or have an effect...And to look Back on Myself and don't see the Guy I Hate..</p>
